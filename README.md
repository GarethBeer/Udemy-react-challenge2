This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

1. Create a react app

2. Create an input field (in app component) with a change listener which outputs the length of the entered text below it (e.g in a paragraph).

3. Create a new component (=> Validation) which recieves the text length as a prop.

4. Inside the Validation component, either output "Text too short" or "Text long enough" depending on the text length (set a length of oyur choosing).

5. Create another component (=> Char) and style it as an inline box.

6. Render a list of Char components where each component recieves a different letter of the entered text (in the initial input field) as a prop.

7. when you click a Char component it should be removed from the entered text.
